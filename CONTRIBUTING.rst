Contributing to the Health Monitor
==================================

To contribute, please open a pull request with the user story you wish
to implement. The commit message should note which user story (via
issue number) is being addressed by this commit. A user story is only
*done* when the conditions in the section *Definition of Done* are
met.

For smaller bugs, a user story is not necessary. Please explain the
nature of the bug in the pull request. While this does not require a
feature test, a unittest that tests for the specific bug is required.

Definition of Done
==================

A user story (or issue) is *done* when the following conditions are
met:

- There is a feature test for the user story.
- The coverage of unittests is above 85%.
- All feature tests pass.
- All unit tests pass.

This also applies to pull requests.
